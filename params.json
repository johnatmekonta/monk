{"name":"Monk","tagline":"Where I blog about websites, cycling, coffee and general guff unsuitable for for the company blog","body":"# The awkward first post\r\nI've never been the most regular blogger. But I've had a bit of a hankering recently to document some work stuff that wouldn't be entirely appropriate on the main company site. Plus the ability to blog on random thoughts such as coffee, bike racing and TV programs.\r\n\r\nSo this might end up being a rather random collection of blog posts. Or, not that unlikely, a very sparse collection of infrequently written posts.\r\n\r\nBy trade I'm a web designer - the templates for this blog will be intentionally minimal and likely image free. My main aim is to write quickly, to document odd things as I want to and not feel obliged to source good photography or create designs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
